            I was attracted to the bold typeface and my attention was immediately drawn to all the right places for this website as soon as I clicked on it. I love how the background color changes smoothly as you scroll through the homepage and through different sections. The color vibes mesh very well with their mission and company culture, which promises to create experience that people cannot "help but love".

            This page made me cringe because although it is definitely eye-catching, it is in a way that makes my eyes and head hurt. The font and logo are childish and look like they came out of a children's coloring book. I get that they are trying to target children for their swimming classes, but I think there's a better way to appear fun and vibrant without making it obnoxious.
